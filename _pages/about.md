I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China). I mainly work on computer vision, intelligent perception, multi-sensor fusion algorithms, and bio-inspired sensors. I am also deeply interested in LLMs/VLMs. Feel free to reach out for collaboration and discussion!
